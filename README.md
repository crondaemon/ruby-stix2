# ruby-stix2
Ruby implementation for the STIX protocol version 2

# Installation

Install the gem as standalone

```
gem install ruby-stix2
```

or as part of the bundle

```
bundle add typhoeus
```

# Usage

The gem implements the Stix2 v2.1 specifications: https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/stix-v2.1.html. Every object
is under the Stix2 namespace, and under a more specific namespace.

Example

```ruby
Stix2::DomainObject::Indicator.new(
  type: 'indicator',
  id: 'file--1389b98d-a3d3-5190-a996-716fd444059a',
  description: 'description',
  indicator_types: ['anomalous-activity', 'anonymization'],
  pattern: 'pattern',
  pattern_type: 'yara',
  pattern_version: 1,
  valid_from: Time.now,
  valid_until: Time.now,
  kill_chain_phases: [
    {
      kill_chain_name: "lockheed-martin-cyber-kill-chain",
      phase_name: "reconnaissance"
    },
    {
      kill_chain_name: "foo",
      phase_name: "pre-attack"
    }
  ]
)
```

The real objects can be created just starting from properties. However a `Stix2.parse` complimentary function is provided. This function gives the user few advantages, listed below.

## Parse input

The function accept a `Hash` (containing the attributes), a string (containing a JSON, on which `JSON.parse` is
executed). If the input is not hash or string, the function tries to run `to_s` on the object and then JSON.parse.

```ruby
Stix2.parse(type: 'indicator')
Stix2.parse('type' => 'indicator')
Stix2.parse('{"type":"indicator"}')
Stix2.parse(MyObject.new(...))
```

## Return

The function infers the `type` attribute of the input and determines which is the proper instance to create. This 
results in a fancy way of processing Stix2 input: basically give whatever you have to it and you will get the proper
Stix2 message.

# Storage

The Stix2 standard has several object types, some of which are containers of other objects (like `Bundle`). However we
may want to save and retrieve Stix2 objects in a fast way. The gem provides a `storage` support for that.

For any Stix2 attribute that is an `identifier` (`Stix2::Identifier` in the gem) the class gives one more method called
`_instance` to retrieve the actual instance. If we have a `threat-actor` like this

```json
{
  "type": "threat-actor",
  "spec_version": "2.1",
  "id": "threat-actor--8e2e2d2b-17d4-4cbf-938f-98ee46b3cd3f",
  "created_by_ref": "identity--f431f809-377b-45e0-aa1c-6a4751cae5ff",
  "created": "2016-04-06T20:03:48.000Z",
  "modified": "2016-04-06T20:03:48.000Z",
  "threat_actor_types": ["crime-syndicate"],
  "name": "Evil Org",
  "description": "The Evil Org threat actor group",
  "aliases": ["Syndicate 1", "Evil Syndicate 99"],
  "roles": ["director"],
  "goals": ["Steal bank money", "Steal credit cards"],
  "sophistication": "advanced",
  "resource_level": "team",
  "primary_motivation": "organizational-gain"
}
```

we know that this object has been created by an identity `identity--f431f809-377b-45e0-aa1c-6a4751cae5ff`. We can
retrieve the other object if already seen

```ruby
Stix2.storage_activate # Activate the storage

identity = Stix2::DomainObject::Identity.new(id: 'identity--f431f809-377b-45e0-aa1c-6a4751cae5ff', ...)
threat_actor = Stix2::DomainObject::ThreatActor.new(created_by_ref: 'identity--f431f809-377b-45e0-aa1c-6a4751cae5ff', ...)

threat_actor.created_by_ref # this gives the identifier => identity--f431f809-377b-45e0-aa1c-6a4751cae5ff
threat_actor.created_by_ref_instance # this gives the actual object => Stix2::DomainObject::Identity
```

# Spec versions

This gem implements the spec version `2.1`. However older version (especially 2.0) can be compatible. To force the gem
to accept another spec version, just add them to the `SPEC_VERSIONS` variable.

```ruby
Stix2::SPEC_VERSIONS << '2.0'
```
